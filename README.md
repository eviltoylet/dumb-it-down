# dumb-it-down
A bookmarklet that makes the selected text easier to read by "dumbing it down." This means replacing difficult words with
easier words and removing information deemed unnecessary.

This is a work-in-progress and currently doesn't do anything.

# Installation
Add a bookmark to your bookmarks bar with the URL: 
`javascript:` + contents of `dumb-it-down.js`

# Usage
1. Select text that you want to dumb down
2. Click the bookmarklet you made
